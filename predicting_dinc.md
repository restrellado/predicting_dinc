Introduction
========================================================

- DINC titles are straight forward, but calculations not so much 
- Understanding how the CDE does these calculations will put you in the driver's seat 
- Use this new knowledge to correct DINC problems earlier and 
more frequently 


Part 1: Reproducing CDE's Results 
========================================================

- Reproducing results = learning the methods 
- Learning CDE's methods makes for better predictions 


The Dataset
========================================================

Demonstration


Overdue 60 Day Timelines 
========================================================

- INIT_EVAL - PRNT_CNST > 60 days
- No EVLDLAY code
- Demonstration


Overdue Annual Reviews 
========================================================

- REPT_DATE - LAST_IEP > 1 year
- No IEPDELAY code
- Demonstration


Overdue Triennial Reviews 
========================================================

- REPT_DATE - LAST_EVAL > 3 years
- No TRIDELAY code
- Demonstration


Overdue Third Birthday Evals 
========================================================

- INIT_EVAL - BIRTHDATE >= 1095
- No TBDLAY code
- Demonstration


Noncompliant Tran Regs
========================================================

- TRAN_REG1 - TRAN_REG8
- Demonstration


Part 2: Getting Good at Predictions 
========================================================


Making Better Predictions 
========================================================

- Record your predictions and compare to CDE's results 
- Keeping your Excel skills sharp will make you faster 
- Being fast leads to more frequent predictions 
- Make predictions frequent and early 
- Try reproducing another of CDE's compliance scores 


Adapting to the New System
========================================================

- We still expect DINC to be monitored 
- A well thought out process will survive the change
