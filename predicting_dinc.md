Introduction
========================================================

- DINC titles are straight forward, but calculations not so much 
- Understanding how the CDE does these calculations will put you in the driver's seat 
- Use this new knowledge to correct DINC problems earlier and 
more frequently 


Part 1: Reproducing CDE's Results 
========================================================

- Reproducing results = learning the methods 
- Learning CDE's methods makes for better predictions 


The Dataset
========================================================

Demonstration


1. Overdue 60 Day Timelines 
========================================================

Demonstration


2. Overdue Annual Reviews 
========================================================

Demonstration


3. Overdue Triennial Reviews 
========================================================

Demonstration


4. Overdue Third Birthday Evals 
========================================================

Demonstration


5. Noncompliant Tran Regs
========================================================

Part 2: Getting Good at Predictions 
========================================================


Making Better Predictions 
========================================================

- Record your predictions and compare to CDE's results 
- Keeping your Excel skills sharp will make you faster 
- Being fast leads to more frequent predictions 
- Make predictions frequent and early 
- Try reproducing another of CDE's compliance scores 


Adapting to the New System
========================================================

- We still expect DINC to be monitored 
- A well thought out process will survive the change
